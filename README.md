#Create a Currency Converter

##Description
Create two Ruby classes. One will be for storing currency values. The other will
be used to hold the conversion forumula and rates.


1. Currency Class
  * Currency objects are created with a currency code and amount
  * Should be able to tell if two currency objects have the same currency code
  or not
  * Can add, subtract, or multiply currency objects with the same currency code
  * Currency class should be able to take one argument with a currency symbol
  embedded in it, like "$1.20" or "â‚¬ 7.00", and figure out the correct currency
  code and amount


2. Converter Class
  * Initialized with a hash of currency codes to conversion rates
  * Should be able to take a Currency object that has one currency code and a
  requested currency code and return a new Currency object with the new currency
  code


3. Build a third class called CurrencyTrader.
  * Initialize with two CurrencyConverter objects from two different points in
  time (each one will have different conversion rates), plus a starting Currency.
  * Created a method in CurrencyTrader which returns the best currency investment
  over that span of time.
